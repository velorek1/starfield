# Starfield Animation with SDL2
A simple SDL2 starfield animation.
Most of the ideas where taken from this wonderful classic:

The code initializes an SDL window, handles user input, and renders a starfield with a streak effect.

# To compile:
  - Install SDL2 libraries and compile and link with "gcc nstar.c -o nstar -lSDL2 -lm"
  - Alternatively run "bash compile.sh"
